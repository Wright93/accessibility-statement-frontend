accessibilityProblems:
  - Screen readers won’t be able to know the difference in some of the page navigation across the service. This may cause confusion when navigating through pages.
  - The menu toggle disappears when clicked if it is being viewed the service on a small screen.
  - The language selector is right aligned and the breadcrumbs are left aligned on the same visual row but the tabbing order sends you to the language selector first.
    Also, on small screens, the breadcrumbs do not reflow.
  - The HMRC banner logo visual display and reading out order for assistive technology is not consistent, so some users may get confused.
  - The breadcrumb colour and focus states use a light grey, which affects colour contrast. Some visually impaired users may struggle to read everything on this page.
  - Welsh translations are incomplete. The following copy is not translated to Welsh - ‘Skip to main content’ - ‘All content is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0, except where otherwise stated’ - ‘Crown Copyright’
