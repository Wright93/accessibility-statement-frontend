accessibilityProblems:
  - some of the links are missed out when users tab through the page. There are also some visually hidden links
    which can be confusing as users cannot work out where they are in the page.
  - some of the table headers are empty. This means that users will not be given information about the purpose of
    the table or the columns. This can make it hard to work out what the table is about.
  - some of the error messages do not make it clear what has gone wrong. This can make it difficult to work out how to
    fix your answer.
  - when using the service on a mobile device, some of the links cannot be accessed by assistive technology.
  - on some pages, there is content that is linked but is not read out as a list. This can make it more difficult to
    understand for users with screen readers.
  - in the ‘Update your estimated income’ section, the page titles for two consecutive pages are the same. This
    may be confusing for some users with screen readers.
  - there is some content that disappears when you hover over it. This will make it difficult for users who use the
    text spacing technique as a way of improving their reading experience.
  - on some pages, you have to scroll horizontally to read everything on the screen.
  - on the ‘Employment name’ page, the highlighted state of the selectable elements does not match the recommended
    colour contrast in the GOV.UK Design System.
  - on some pages, the heading and the label are duplicated. This means a screen reader will read this information twice.
  - on some pages, the form fields are not tied together in a way that is helpful for people who cannot see the visual
    layout of the form. This can make the question and the hint text difficult to understand.
  - in some places, hint text is not read back screen readers when browsing out of context using the tab command.
    This can make it time consuming to move through the page.
  - on the ‘Income tax estimate’ page, there are empty cells in the table. This could be difficult to understand for
    people who cannot see the visual layout of the table.
