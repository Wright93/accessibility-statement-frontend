accessibilityProblems:
  - Page titles don’t include the service name. This does not follow HMRC's design pattern
    and does not make it clear what service you are on when using a screen reader.
    We will be updating these so they follow our pattern.
  - Some of the information is read out twice by a screen reader because the designs do not follow the pattern. We will fix this so that all of the information is only read once.
  - On one of the pages, there is a link to guidance which opens in the same tab, meaning users lose their progress.
    We will change this so it opens in a new tab and users can carry on with the journey.
  - On all pages, error messages are not linked to the fields they relate to. This means they will not be read by assistive technology
    if the user moves straight to the field. We will fix this so they are all linked to the field and read out properly.
    Users can still use the browse mode to find this information.

      There is extra information being read out that users should not hear when using a screen reader.
      This fails WCAG 2.1 - Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.1 - Bypass Blocks and Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.1 - Parsing. 
      We will fix this to remove anything that a user doesn’t need to hear.

      When there is an error on the page, we usually put the word ‘Error’ into the page title. We have not done this in the service.
      This fails WCAG 2.1 - Understanding Success Criterion 3.3.1 - Error Identification. We will be updating our page titles to 
      contain the word ‘Error’ when there is an error on the page.

      When there is an error, the keyboard focus is on the wrong part of the page. This makes it more difficult to work out if there has been an error.
      This fails WCAG 2.1 - Understanding Success Criterion 3.3.1 - Error Identification. We will fix this so the error state has keyboard focus and the 
      user knows there has been an error.

      We ask for money amounts within this service, and have not added pound signs to show that this is the currency we want users to use. 
      This fails WCAG 2.1 - Understanding Success Criterion 3.3.2 - Labels or Instructions. 
      We will fix this to add in pound signs so the user knows we want amounts in great british pounds.

      There are some links in the footer of the service that are not read out by a screen reader. 
      This fails WCAG 2.1 - Understanding Success Criterion 1.3.1 - Info and Relationships. 
      We will fix this so that all items in the footer are read out by a screen reader.

      We have a time limit in the service before we reset all your answers for your security. We do not have a message that tells users we will do this. 
      This fails WCAG 2.1 - F58 - Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.1 due to using server-side techniques to automatically redirect pages after a time-out 
      and Understanding Success Criterion 2.2.6 - Timeouts. We will add a message telling users when they are going to be timed out and give the option to stay in the service.

      We have hint text to help users give the right information. This has been coded wrong so it will not be read out by a screen reader or screen magnifier. 
      This fails WCAG 2.1 - Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.1 - Parsing.
      We will fix this so a screen reader can read out all hint text.

      Some of the pages in our service have checkboxes that do not have focus when using high contrast mode. This fails WCAG 2.1 - 
      Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.7 - Focus Visible. We will fix this so the checkboxes have keyboard focus.

      On pages where we ask for an amount of money, we currently do not show the keyboard for numbers on a mobile device. This fails WCAG 2.1 - 
      Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.2 - Name, Role, Value. We will update the service so a user can access those pages using a number keypad on mobile devices.

      On some pages there is no hint text to help users give the right information. This fails WCAG 2.1 - Understanding Success Criterion 3.3.2 - 
      Labels or Instructions. We will add hint text to make it clear what users need to enter.

      On some pages, when using a screen reader users are given information that should be hidden, like spaces. This fails WCAG 2.1 - Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.1 - 
      Parsing. We will fix this so users do not hear anything that is not useful or could be confusing.

      On some pages, we have boxes to add dates, and these are not read out right by a screen reader. This fails WCAG 2.1 - Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.2 - 
      Name, Role, Value. We will fix this so these fields are read out correctly and users know how to interact with them.

      When there is focus on fields, radios and checkboxes in the service, the colour does not meet the minimum colour contrast. This fails WCAG 2.1 - Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3 - 
      Contrast (Minimum). We will fix this to make it easier for users to see where the focus is on the page.

      Some of our error messages do not work properly which can cause issues for users. This fails WCAG 2.1 - Understanding Success Criterion 3.3.3 -
