  - Some of the pages in the service have a redundant fieldset, which could prevent users browsing out of context from understanding what is being selected
  - The 'Have you applied for money laundering supervision with HMRC?' page does not have a fieldset and legend attribute, so the purpose of the radio buttons may be unclear for some users
