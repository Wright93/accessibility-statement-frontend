accessibilityProblems:
  - Some missing end tags may cause visual content errors on pages. This may be more noticeable for people who use screen readers.
  - The menu toggle when viewing the service on a small screen disappears when clicked.
  - The service name is located within the navigation. This may cause confusion with screen readers.
  - The back links are currently in the main landmark and are not bypassed using the skip link or possible to bypass with assistive technology.
  - When there is an error on the page, it is not displayed in the page title so screen readers cannot read it out.
  - The error summary font size is too small and error messages on inputs do not display as errors for screen readers.
  - Hints are not read out by screen readers because of the current page structure.
  - There are some incorrect HTML attributes, which may cause visual content errors on pages. This may be more noticeable for people who use screen readers.
  - The page tabs do not give the user enough information about what page they are on in their titles.
  - The menu toggle has issues when being used on a small screen.
  - Screen readers cannot search for links using the first letter of the link, so users may not be able to search easily for terms.
  - On ‘Check your answers’ pages, screen readers may not read out the right label for each answer.
  - There are some incorrect HTML elements, which may cause visual content errors on pages. This may be more noticeable for people who use screen readers.
  - Some hidden text for screen readers has not been set up correctly preventing some screen readers from working correctly.
  - Some colours used within the service do not have a clear colour contrast, so some visually impaired users may struggle to read everything.
  - Welsh translations are incomplete. The following copy is not translated to Welsh - ‘Skip to main content’ - ‘Use software to send Income Tax Updates’ (in page title and header) - ‘Help’ in ‘Help gyda'r dudalen hon.’ - ‘Help’ in ‘Help wrth ddefnyddio GOV.UK’ - ‘All content is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0, except where otherwise stated’.
  - The user is unable to increase font sizes on all pages. Some visually impaired users may struggle to read everything.
  - The date of birth input is partially incomplete, so users cannot autofill values.
  - The confirmation screen uses a light shade of green which affects colour contrast, so some visually impaired users may struggle to read everything on this page.

      Some colours used within the service do not have a clear colour contrast, so some visually impaired users may struggle to read everything. This
      doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.3 (Contrast minimum). The latest WCAG 2.1 updates for colour and focus states, which are more
      accessible, are in place now and need to be applied. This should fix the issues relating to the breadcrumbs (currently a light grey),
      as well as the skip link and other links against the focus state background colour not meeting the colour contrast guidelines.
